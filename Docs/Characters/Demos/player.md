# Unity Project: Survival Adventure - Documentation - Player features demo

The Player sandbox scene can be found in `/Assets/_GAME/_FINAL/Characters/Demos/Player`.

This sandbox scene is meant to test all the player features in a safe environment.

It uses the default player prefab (as described in [Player documentation main page](../Player/README.md)).

Run *Play Mode*, and start using the inputs described in [Inputs documentation](../../Inputs/README.md) to interact with the player character and its environment.
