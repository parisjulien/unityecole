# Unity Project: Survival Adventure - Documentation - Shaders

In this project, we use Unity's *Shader Graph* tool to create our own shaders. But since this project is also an introduction to shaders, there's two parts to this documentation:

- [How shaders work in general (not only in Unity)?](./shaders-theory.md)
- [How to use Shader Graph to create the different shaders of this project?](./List/README.md)
