# Unity Project: Survival Adventure - Documentation - Character animations demo

The character animations demo can be found in `/Assets/_GAME/_FINAL/Characters/Demos/CharacterAnimations`.

The demo scene in that directory allow you to test the `AnimatorController` used on the base character prefab. Open the *SC_Demos_CharacterAnimations* scene and start testing animations.

## The `Demos_CharacterAnimations` component

If you select the *Character* in the scene hierarchy, you will see a *Character Animations* component attached to it. Run *Play Mode*, and start using the controls to test how the animator behaves!

Feel free to open this script to see how it interacts with the `Animator` component.

Also note that the control buttons that you see in the inspector are drawn using a custom editor. See the `Demos_CharacterAnimationsEditor` script for more informations about how they are drawn in the editor.
